    <p class="lead text-center">Inspired by art at a very young age, the tattoo community was always something I have been enamoured by. To be able to decorate the human body is something extremely fulfilling for me. Taking someone’s vision and making it come to life through my eyes is an indescribable feeling.</p>
    <p class="lead">I started my apprenticeship in 2009, and was then mentored by a few truly amazing artists who helped me every step of the way.</p>

    <p class="lead">I’d like to think my work speaks for itself. As an artist I’ve always liked to challenge myself to new projects and try not to ever get "too" comfortable with one style. It is my job to make your tattoo everything you’ve envisioned and more.</p>
